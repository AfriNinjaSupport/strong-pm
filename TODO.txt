deploy: url is not valid when the port is closed from strong-deploy, bad

pm: protocol, remove current, put sub in command, but if target is present,
 assume it goes to supervisor... will make things nicer

BUG: npm-ls seems to cause .size to be reset on instance update

stdout is logged twice (the colors are different, can't be seen here):

lib/client, do we need?

move index.js to bin/sl-pm.js

having log-dump not have a default SRV_ID is hostile

the usage should be `SVCID`, I think

when current svc is restored on restart, mesh models isn't informed

stop/stat either isn't working, or isn't logging anything...

I'm losing runner processes... which end up busy-looping, looks like an iojs
bug.

Run request for commit "undefined/undefined in /home/sam/w/sn/strong-pm/.strong-pm/svc/2/work/
... ^--- repo/commit SHA isn't being read out of directory name?

started message should have PWD in it

debug for notifications should contain svcId
