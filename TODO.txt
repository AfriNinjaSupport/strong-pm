deploy: url is not valid when the port is closed from strong-deploy, bad

pm: protocol, remove current, put sub in command, but if target is present,
 assume it goes to supervisor... will make things nicer

create/ls/remove should be svc-create, svc-list, svc-remove

you can create any number of services with the same name... its confusing

how to disable metrics?

strong-pm start with no deploy: `sl-meshctl status 1` asserts

Service default hard stopped <--- quote the svc name
